                <h1 class="work-intro-header">A brief description of my previous work experiences</h1>
                <p class="work-intro-paragraph"> During my sophomore year at Stony Brook University, I began working as a lab technician before securing an engineering internship with the nearby Air Techniques company. 
                    I relocated to St. Louis after receiving my degree to work at Boeing as a firmware engineer. The factory primarily manufactures defense-related goods.
                    I helped Boeing's team with the firmware design for the future aircraft model's APG. I have worked with program management tasks, FPGA, VHDL, SPI, and UART. 
                    I changed jobs during the pandemic and relocated to the east coast. At their location in New Jersey, I joined Lockheed MartinÂ as an embedded electronics engineer. 
                    Since then, I've been working at this company with pleasure. To make it easier,
                    here is my professional work history in a table format,

                <p>
                    At the Lockheed Martin plant in New Jersey, almost all of the work is secret. Solid state radars are what we principally produce for the US and our allies. 
                    There are also some space-related works. Technical prowess, fostering relationships with clients, and visiting diverse product locations are all aspects of our business. 
                    I am involved with solid state radar technology. Here are some of my worth mentioning responsibilities:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Supporting design and test simulation of various firmware components(fpga, spi, adc, etc.) of radar systems (i.e. LRDR, AAJ) </li>
                    <li>Continuously building new python script and exploring existing python scripts(improvement opportunity with OOP) for useful data analyzing captured during requirement testing operation in the test site</li>
                    <li>Practicing affordability initiatives including Agile, automation and all other Digital Transformation activities to better meet daily goals and achieve customer satisfaction</li>
                    <li>Analyze hardware, software, and firmware issues during the system calibration, create jira issues and collaborate with other teams to solve the issues on time</li>
                </ul>

                <a href="https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/index.html">Lockheed martin</a> always likes innovation and encourages employees to pursue higher studies. I have gained a lot of
                interest towards software development lately. Lockheed martin's education program is sponsoring me for my masters degree in software
                development at Boston university.
