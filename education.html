                    <p>My educational history began as a high school senior when I transferred from Bangladesh to US.
                        I didn't have enough background knowledge about SATs yet managed to get into CUNY city college in the engineering program. 
                        Soon, I transferred to Stony Brook University to which was my target school. Their curriculum, environment, overall quality of education, and tuition fees were the key factors behind my decision to move there. 
                        After being at professional field for 2 years, I have chosen BU's online software development for my master's study.
                        It has been a great experience so far and I highly recommend this program for those of you who are interested to study software development.
